**Team Contract (ziruiw3-weixuan6-hua13-zixuanl9)**


## Communication
- Team Meetings Our team will meet once a week every Friday from 7-9 PM in-person at Grainger Library Study Room. The notetaker will be hua13 throughout the semester to record thoughts or ideas during the Team Meeting. Notes will be stored on a Google docs, time-stamped for each meeting. 
- Assistance Each team member can be contacted through zoom meetings or in person. We promise to respond to team messages within 24 hours.
- Respect We will make sure that everyoneâ€™s ideas are respected and listened to. If conflict occurs, we will do a poll to make decisions together. 


## Collaboration
- Work Distribution Each week, every member of the team will be assigned the similar amount of work and every member is expected to commit and push the code on git at least once to mark as their contribution to the group in that week. 
- Time Commitment Each member is expected to independently work about three hours and maximum five hours per week on the project. If for some reason some of us spend too much time on a specific problem, other team members are responsible to help out and accelerate the process.
- Conflict Resolution All conflicts within the team will be decided by vote.
